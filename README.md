## About Honor Code

- If there are same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. 
- The owner of this repository should not take any commitment for other's faults.

- According to the student handbook (2015 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.

- If you find any problems in the repository, welcome to make an issue or pull request.
